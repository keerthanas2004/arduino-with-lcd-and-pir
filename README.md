# arduino-with-lcd-and-pir
Arduino Code for sensing the presence of humans using PIR Sensor with a time limit.

Here, We have used a 20 by 4 LCD Display and a PIR Sensor. When the PIR senses movement using IR radiations, the LED gets turned ON and the LCD Display shows a welcome message with the remaining amount of time they are allowed to be in the specific place and when exceeded the specific limit(in this case, 10s), the LED starts to blink and an ALERT MESSAGE is printed on the LCD Display. When the person leaves the place, a THANK YOU message is also print for a few seconds.
